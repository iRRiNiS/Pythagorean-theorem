# Pythagorean-theorem
Distance calculators.

By default, just running the code from any of these languages should print the distance between `(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)` and `(4.0, 5.0, 6.0)`, which is about `5.196`.

If you're adding a language yourself, make sure that:
* There are 2 functions: `distance2d` and `distance3d` which both accept 2 sets of coordinates: `from` and `to`.
* The code actually runs/compiles and prints the distance between `x=1.0,y=2.0,z=3.0` and `x=4.0,y=5.0,z=6.0`. (It should be around `5.196`)
* It is coded like all the other examples, with `diff x`, `diff y` and `delta` variables for 2D distances and `from 2d`, `to 2d`, `diff x`, `diff y` and `delta` variables for 3D distances. Both functions should return the variable `delta`. (Format the variables according to the language you're using: `diff_x` and `diffX` will both work)
